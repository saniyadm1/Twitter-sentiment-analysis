# Twitter-sentiment-analysis
In this project we will talk about a procedure which permits use and understanding of twitter information for sentiment analysis. 
We perform several steps of text pre-processing, and then experiment with multiple classification mechanisms. 
Using a dataset of 50000 tweets and TFIDF features, we compare the accuracy obtained using various classifiers for this task. 
We find that linear SVMs provide us the best accuracy results among the various classifiers tried. 
- Problem statement: 
-- Given: Tweet
-- Predict: Sentiment polarity of the tweet â€“ positive vs negative
- The code is contained in the Jupyter notebook: TwitterSentimentAnalysis.ipynb
To be able to run this, you must have Jupyter notebook installed on your machine.
It can be run on any platform: Windows, Linux, Mac-OS
- Installations needed:
Anaconda prompt, Jupyter notebook, numpy, pandas, sklearn, NLTK
- Hardware requirement: Any operating system that supports Python. Less than 2 GB RAM.
- Training the model takes a few hours on a machine with 8 processors.
- Software requirement: Python
